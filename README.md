# Decliner
 Automatically declines common player interactions
 
**automatically declines:**

* channel invites  
* duel requests  
* pet-battle duel requests  
* group invites  
* guild invites  
* guild petitions  
* whispers  
* trade requests

**from players when:**

* you haven't recently whispered them  
* they aren't in your party or raid  
* they aren't in your guild  
* they aren't on your friends list  
* they aren't a battle.net friend

#Features#

###Account or character settings###

Save your options account-wide or per character.


###Blocks sounds and other messages###

All the UI clicks, event sounds, and chat/info text that occurs from interactions are silenced when an action is blocked. If you disabled notifications, you wouldn't know if anything was blocked at all.


###Spam prevention###

You will be notified only once within a certain time if a player is repeatedly sending you interactions. The more they send, the longer that specific notification is hidden. Whispers, or amount of times the player bothered you, are in a tooltip on their name in the chat message.


###Forgetting players you whispered###

After some time, players that were allowed because you whispered them will be forgotten.


###Opening group invites when you need them###

Sometimes you need an invite to a world raid group or for a portal from someone nearby. When you say "invite", "portal", or "1" in a public message, anyone will be allowed to invite you. Once you join a group, change zones, or after 5 minutes, invite blocking will return to normal.
You can edit these trigger words, as well as what channels are watched, in the options.


Type **/decliner**, **/decline**, or **/dcl** for the options.


Inspired by addons such as [AutoDecline](http://wow.curseforge.com/projects/auto-decline), [Broker_AntiSocial](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info11370), [AntiSocial](http://wow.curseforge.com/projects/anti-social), and [InviteBlock](http://www.wowace.com/addons/project-13367).

I would appreciate assistance with [translation and review of localization](http://wow.curseforge.com/projects/decliner/localization) if you can help.

**Please use the [curseforge ticket system](http://wow.curseforge.com/projects/decliner/issues) to report bugs, issues, or offer suggestions such as an interaction you want to see supported or changing how the addon works**

If you prefer something friendlier than tickets, or want a discussion instead of a ticket, I occasionally check these threads:
